# Car Parking System - Project Summary

## Project Overview
A RESTful API system for managing a car parking lot built with NestJS and TypeScript. The system provides automated parking management without human intervention.

## Key Features Implemented
✅ Initialize parking lot with configurable size
✅ Dynamic parking lot expansion
✅ Automated slot allocation (nearest to entry)
✅ Car parking with registration and color tracking
✅ Slot deallocation by slot number or registration
✅ Query cars by color
✅ Query slot by registration number
✅ Real-time parking statistics
✅ Comprehensive error handling
✅ Input validation with DTOs
✅ Swagger API documentation
✅ Unit and E2E tests

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Framework**: NestJS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Validation**: class-validator

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Dependency Injection**: NestJS IoC container
2. **DTO Pattern**: Request/Response validation
3. **Repository Pattern**: Data access encapsulation
4. **Singleton Pattern**: Single parking lot instance

### Time Complexity Analysis
- **Park Car**: O(n) - Linear search for first available slot
- **Free Slot**: O(1) - Direct hash map access
- **Query by Color**: O(k) - Where k is cars with that color
- **Query by Registration**: O(1) - Hash map lookup
- **Get Status**: O(n) - Iterate through all slots

### Data Structures Used
- **Map<number, ParkingSlot>**: Slot management
- **Map<string, number>**: Registration to slot mapping
- **Map<string, Set<number>>**: Color to slots mapping

## Test Coverage
- Unit Tests: 18 tests passing
- Code Coverage: ~56% overall
- E2E Tests: Full workflow testing

## API Endpoints
1. `POST /parking_lot` - Initialize parking lot
2. `PATCH /parking_lot` - Expand parking lot
3. `POST /park` - Park a car
4. `POST /clear` - Free a slot
5. `GET /status` - Get occupied slots
6. `GET /registration_numbers/:color` - Cars by color
7. `GET /slot_numbers/:color` - Slots by color
8. `GET /slot_number/:registrationNumber` - Slot by registration
9. `GET /statistics` - Parking statistics

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-level parking support
- Parking fee calculation
- Time-based parking limits
- Vehicle type categorization
- Reservation system
- Historical parking data
